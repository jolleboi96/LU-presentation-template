# Lund university/Lunds Tekniska HÃ¶gskola powerpoint presentation template
Public access to a google slides template (converted to .pptx) for presentations at LTH and Lund university. Based on the Beamer template by Sebastian Pfaff available here: https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/lund-university-beamer-template/fzvjyvwtpgfv \
Hope this can be useful to other students who wish to create a Master Thesis presentation or some other work at LU/LTH. I (Joel Wulff), used this template for my Master Thesis.
